# 1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points

```
On a 2D plane, there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by points.
You can move according to these rules:
	- In 1 second, you can either:
	
		- move vertically by one unit,
		- move horizontally by one unit, or
		- move diagonally sqrt(2) units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in 1 second).
	
	
	- You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
	- You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.
 
Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal path is [1,1] -&gt; [2,2] -&gt; [3,3] -&gt; [3,4] -&gt; [2,3] -&gt; [1,2] -&gt; [0,1] -&gt; [-1,0]   
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds
Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
Output: 5
 
Constraints:
	- points.length == n
	- 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100
	- points[i].length == 2
	- -1000 &lt;= points[i][0], points[i][1] &lt;= 1000
